Unit 1 Homework: Threat Assessment Analysis
Well, you've made it!
Welcome to your future career as a cybersecurity professional. In this homework assignment, you will continue the work you began in class by completing the Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Vocabulary and Report Analysis. As discussed in class, learning to make sense of recent events in the cybersecurity landscape is a critical skill to hone for your future career.



Before You Begin


Create a Google Drive (https://www.google.com/drive/) account if you do not already have one.


Then create a folder called 01-Cyber-Report inside your Google Drive.


Right-click the 01-Cyber-Report folder and select Get Shareable Link. You will use this folder to submit your homework when complete and the folder needs to be shareable so we can access it.


Inside your 01-Cyber-Report folder include each part of your assignment.



Part I: Vocabulary Report
In this section of the assignment, you'll use independent research to define key terms found in the Security Reports. Then, you will use the reports themselves to communicate the significance of these key terms in their relative context. When communicating their context, you should offer a relevant factoid, case study, or explanation of their relevance in the report.

Part II: Report Analysis
In this section, you'll use each of the provided reports to answer a variety of questions relevant to current security landscape. For each question, try to be detailed but succinct. Offer enough information to demonstrate your understanding of the subject, but keep your responses within a few bullets or sentences.

Hints and Considerations


This assignment should feel time-consuming! As you will discover in this class, each homework assignment is designed to challenge you in a different way. Some will be technically difficult, while others will be require close reading of detailed subject matter. Treat each task as a critical step in your goal of becoming a security professional.


Feel encouraged to work closely with your classmates outside of class on this. It's a great opportunity to build bonds with your peers. You'll need them as you progress through class.


If you struggle to answer a few questions, consider attending office hours before or after class to get help.
